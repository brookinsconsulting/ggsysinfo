Changes from 0.7 to 0.8 - released 2014/10/13

New:
- a view showing efficiency of realpath cache configuration in php.ini; useful especially when using the eZ5 stack:
  sysinfo/realpath
- vastly improved support for cluster mode:
  the views "system status", "log file stats", "cache stats", "storage stats", "phpinfo" and opcode caches are clustered:
  when appropriately configured, they will display data from all nodes in the cluster, in an iframe for each.
  This extends to viewing contents of log files from all cluster nodes from a single console!
  Configuration is done in sysinfo.ini
- a view listing all available workflow event types and the workflows using them
- the report.php cli script now can generate a report with all ini settings
- the "log view" view can now display any custom logs, not just ezpublish ones. Including Smfony ones :-)
- the "cache stats" view does display size of Smfony on-disk caches as well as eZ4 caches
- bumped up php requirements to version 5.3

Improved:
- the systemstatus view can be extended with custom tests from other extensions
- the list of views available in the System Information tab can be extended by other extensions
- the list of reports available on the command line can be extended by other extensions
- the views showing cache and storage stats have been separated into a "local" and "clustered" view when in ezdfs
  mode. This allows to f.e. query the local data often without hitting the NFS mount at all
- lots of internal refactoring. If you had extended/patched the extensions, I am sorry. This is better for the long term
- the "content stats" view now reports the number of documents in solr, if ezfind is enabled, plus more data
  about database contents, such as maximum number of nodes and links per object (important for cache clearing)
- the report.php cli script now defaults to listing available reports, not executing all of them (as there are many verbose ones)

Fixed:
- systemstatus tests all report results as '1', '0' or 'X' strings (not integers)
